The goal of this project is to analyze data from an atomic force microscope
Its a three part project:
1st part (plot.py)- is to extract the distance and force data from the text file for each point (i,j) on the surface.
2nd part (estimate_afm) - estimate the slope of the linear looking piece of the curve on the left side of the plots.
3rd part (app) - we write a streamlit app that loads the data and estimates of the slope and generates the information as a heatmap.
